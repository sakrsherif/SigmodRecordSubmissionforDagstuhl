\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The tutorials, presentations, dialogs, and working groups at the ``\emph{Big Stream
  Processing Systems}'' workshop provided an overview of current developments and emerging issues in the areas of: systems,
computational models, architectures and languages for processing large-scale streaming data.
In this report, we highlighted the main outcomes of the workshop. The discussions of the workshop have also revealed the existence of several open challenges and interesting future research directions including the focus on (1) semantic data access and reasoning, (2) defining a standardized query language for streaming applications, (3) providing better support for machine learning including a wide range of data science programming languages (Python, R, Julia), and (4) improving optimizations for low latencies and short-lived stream processing pipelines.
