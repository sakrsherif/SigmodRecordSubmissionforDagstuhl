\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

The tutorials, presentations, dialogs, and working groups at the
``\emph{Big Stream Processing Systems}'' seminar provided an overview
of current developments and emerging issues.  This report highlighted
the main outcomes of the seminar. The discussions of the seminar have
also revealed several open challenges and interesting future research
directions including (1)~semantic data access and reasoning,
(2)~defining a standardized query language for streaming applications,
(3)~providing better support for machine learning including a wide
range of data science programming languages (Python, R, Julia), and
(4)~improving optimizations for low latencies and short-lived stream
processing pipelines.
