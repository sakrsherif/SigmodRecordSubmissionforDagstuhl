\begin{alltt}TODO\scriptsize 1 page
- introductory paragraph
  - working group focused on identifying challenges
  - see Section~\ref{sec:tut_lang} for definition and survey
- Challenge: Variety of data models (~0.25 pages)
  - definitions
    - data model organizes elements of data with respect to their
      semantics, their logical composition into data structures,
      and their physical representation
  - why is it important
    - variety of data models driven by the producers and consumers
      of streaming application, as well as internal conversion and
      processing needs
  - why difficult
    - little consensus among streaming languages: StreamIt single
      number, CQL tuple, RSP entire self-describing graph
  - what's unique to streaming
    - data model affects speed of serialization, transmission,
      compression, as well as dynamic checks for the presence
      or absence of certain fields
    - in online setting, no time for separate batch data integration
  - what's unique to languages
    - for some languages, the design revolves primarily around
      the data model, e.g., relational algebra on tuples, or
      path expressions on XML trees or RDF graphs
    - compiler opportunity for error messages and optimizations
  - goal(s)
    - language supports different data models
    - programmer uses logical data model that is easiest for them
    - compiler and runtime system choose best physical
      representation and transform program accordingly
  - metrics
    - expressive power, like relational completeness
    - performance (throughput, latency, resource consumption)
- Challenge: Veracity with simplicity (~0.25 pages)
  - definitions
    - conformance to the facts, accuracy
  - why is it important
    - sensor limitations (accuracy, energy, memory)
    - long-running and loosely coupled, sources come and go
    - approximate algorithms, stream mining, and stream learning
  - why difficult
    - lack of ground truth or gold standard
    - hard to think about and test for every eventuality
  - what's unique to streaming
    - no global clock in distributed setting
    - real-time response with incomplete information
    - in online setting, no time for separate batch data cleansing
  - what's unique to languages
    - for some languages, handling of uncertainty pervades design
    - can limit operators to support revision and retraction
    - probabilistic programming languages can track uncertainty
  - goal(s)
    - minimize compounding uncertainty
    - quality-aware and adaptive
    - keep language simple and expressive
  - metrics
    - precision, recall, f-score, Pareto optimality
    - optimizing vs. satisficing
- Challenge: Adoption (~0.25 pages)
