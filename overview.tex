\section{Overview}\label{sec:overview}

As the world gets more instrumented and connected, we are witnessing a
flood of raw data generated, at high velocity,
from different hardware (e.g., sensors) or software in the form of
streams of data. Examples abound in several
domains including financial markets, surveillance
systems, manufacturing, smart cities, and scalable monitoring
infrastructure. In these domains, there is a strong
requirement to collect, process, and analyze big streams of data
to extract valuable information, discover new insights in
real-time, and detect emerging patterns and outliers. Since 2011
alone, several systems (e.g.,
\textsf{\small SPL}~\cite{hirzel_schneider_gedik_2017},
\textsf{\small Storm}~\cite{toshniwal_et_al_2014},
\textsf{\small Apex}\footnote{\url{https://apex.apache.org/}},
\textsf{\small Spark Streaming}~\cite{zaharia_et_al_2013},
\textsf{\small Flink}~\cite{carbone_et_al_2015},
\textsf{\small Heron}~\cite{kulkarni_et_al_2015}, and
\textsf{\small Beam}~\cite{akidau2015dataflow}) have
been introduced to tackle the real-time processing demands of big
streaming data. However, there are several challenges and open
problems that need to be addressed to improve the state-of-the-art
and achieve further adoption of big stream processing
technology~\cite{sakr2016big}.

This report is based on a seminar on ``\emph{Big Stream
  Processing Systems}'' at Schloss Dagstuhl in Germany
from 29~October to 3~November 2017\footnote{\url{www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=17441}},
%
attended by 29 researchers from 13~countries.
Participants came from different communities including systems, query
languages, benchmarking, stream mining, and semantic stream
processing. A benefit of this seminar was the opportunity for scholars
from different communities to get exposure to each other and get
freely engaged in direct and interactive discussions. The program
consisted of tutorials on the main topics of the seminar, lightning
talks by participants on their research, and two working groups
dedicated to a deeper investigation.  The first working
group focused on applications and system of big stream processing
while the second group focused on 
streaming languages. This report presents highlights and outcomes.
