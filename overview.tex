\section{Overview}\label{sec:overview}

As the world gets more instrumented and connected, we are witnessing a
flood of raw data that is getting generated, at high velocity,
from different hardware (e.g., sensors) or software in the form of
streams of data. Examples of this phenomenon are crucial for several
applications and domains including financial markets, surveillance
systems, manufacturing, smart cities, and scalable monitoring
infrastructure. In these applications and domains, there is a crucial
requirement to collect, process, and analyze big streams of data in
order to extract valuable information, discover new insights in
real-time, and detect emerging patterns and outliers. Since 2011
alone, several systems (e.g.,
\textsf{\small Storm}~\cite{toshniwal_et_al_2014},
\textsf{\small Apex}\footnote{\url{https://apex.apache.org/}},
\textsf{\small Spark Streaming}~\cite{zaharia_et_al_2013},
\textsf{\small Flink}~\cite{carbone_et_al_2015}, and
\textsf{\small Heron}~\cite{kulkarni_et_al_2015}) have
been introduced to tackle the real-time processing demands of big streaming data. However, there are several challenges and open problems that need to be addressed in order to improve the state-of-the-art in this domain and achieve further adoption of big stream processing technology~\cite{sakr2016big}.

This report is based on a five-day seminar on ``\emph{Big Stream
  Processing Systems}'' that took place at Schloss Dagstuhl in Germany
from 29~October to 3~November 2017\footnote{\url{http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=17441}}. The seminar was attended by 29 researchers from  13 countries. Participants came from different communities including systems, query languages, benchmarking, stream mining, and semantic stream processing. A major benefit of this seminar was the opportunity for scholars from different communities to get exposure to each other and get freely engaged in direct and interactive discussions. The seminar program consisted of tutorials on the main topics of the seminar, lightning talks by participants on their research, and two working groups dedicated to a deeper investigation of selected topics. The first group focused on applications and system of big stream processing while the second group focused on analyzing the state-of-the-art of stream processing languages. This report presents highlights from the seminar program.
