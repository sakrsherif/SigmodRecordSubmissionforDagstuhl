Public Notes
----------------------
Dear authors,

The Associate Editor in charge of the article has recommended acceptance
with minor revision. Please read the review carefully, and resubmit with
the suggested changes, in particular, to reduce the article to 4 pages,
which is the limit on the reports that we publish at the SIGMOD Record.

When submitting the revised article, please 
1) submit a cover letter explaining all the changes that have been made.
2) double check all the formatting requests, e.g., 1 inch margin on all
   sides, font 10 for the entire article, and the page size set to Letter
   (8.5 inch by 11 inch).

If you can submit the camera-ready by July 15, I can arrange it to appear
in the June 2018 issue (which is delayed due to some copyright issue).

Sincerely,

Yanlei Diao
Editor-in-Chief, SIGMOD Record

The paper presents an overview of a Dagstuhl seminar on Big Stream
Processing by outlining the tutorial presented as well as the results of
the two respective working groups. This is a rich domain and a lot of work
has been done in multiple sub-areas, which is obvious from the scope of
the workshop. The report is a bit too long for a workshop report and it
would be helpful if it was reduced to around 4 pages. Beyond that, there
are only minor corrections necessary:

On page 4, the authors say "the combination of stream and state, this
remains an open field of research." The sentence doesn't parse right and
should be re-written to something like "the combination of stream and
state still remains an open field of research."
